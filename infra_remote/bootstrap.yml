# In a remote environment such as AWS there are often more steps required to
# bootstrap a system from scratch. For this reason we split the setup into two
# separate playbooks. The tasks in this playbook should only need to be run
# once in order to get all hosts to a common level (e.g. core dependencies
# installed, accounts normalized, etc). The standard platform configuration
# then occurs in the site.yml playbook.

- hosts: all
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    # 1. Scan for remote SSH key and trust (local)
    - import_role:
        name: common
        tasks_from: util_ssh_keyscan

    # 2. Configure host to support ansible
    - import_role:
        name: common
        tasks_from: bootstrap

    # 3. Ensure remote user has appropriate keys and is configured
    - import_role:
        name: common
        tasks_from: util_admin_user
      vars:
        admin: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        keys: "{{ admin_keys }}"

# Now that the remote environment is prepared. Run the standard picoCTF
# platform installation.
- name: Platform Provision
  import_playbook: "site.yml"
