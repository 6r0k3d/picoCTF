CTF-Platform 2
==============

The CTF-Platform is the infrastructure on which picoCTF runs. The 
platform is designed to be easily adapted to other CTF or programming 
competitions.

CTF-Platform 2 targets Ubuntu 14.04 LTS but should work on just about 
any "standard" Linux distribution. It would probably even work on 
Windows. MongoDB must be installed; all default configurations should 
work.

Conventions

Jonathan should fill these in.
