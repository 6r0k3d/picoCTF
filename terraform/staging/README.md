# Staging Infrastructure

This infrastructure will be used for play testing, integration, and development.  It will allow a full end to end test that should match the publicly deployed environment.  It will be internet accessible but is intended to be access controlled to prevent any compromise of the competition.

## Notes
- This terraform creates the necessary server instances and configures networking configurations but does not further provision or configure the servers.
